# Software for modeling

**Learning objectives:**

- Recognize the principles around which the `{tidymodels}` packages were designed.
- Classify models as *descriptive, inferential,* and/or *predictive.*
- Define *descriptive model.*
- Define *inferential model.*
- Define *predictive model.*
- Differentiate between *supervised* and *unsupervised* models.
- Differentiate between *regression* and *classification* models.
- Differentiate between *quantitative* and *qualitative* data.
- Understand the roles that data can have in an analysis.
- Apply the *data science process.*
- Recognize the *phases of modeling.*

## The pit of success

`{tidymodels}` aims to help us fall into the Pit of Success:

> The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks.

- **Avoid confusion:** Software should facilitate proper usage.
- **Avoid mistakes:** Software should make it easy for users to do the right thing.

## Types of models

- **Descriptive models:** Describe or illustrate characteristics of data.
- **Inferential models:** Make some statement of truth regarding a predefined conjecture or idea.
  - Usually delayed feedback between inference and actual result.
- **Predictive models:** Produce the most accurate possible prediction for new data. *Estimation* ("How much?") rather than *inference* ("Will it?").
  - **Mechanistic models** are derived using first principles to produce a model equation that is dependent on assumptions.
  - **Empirically driven models** have more vague assumptions, and are derived directly from the data.

## Terminology

- **Unsupervised models** learn patterns, clusters, etc, but lack an outcome variable.
  - Examples: PCA, clustering, autoencoders.
- **Supervised models** have an outcome variable.
  - Examples: linear regression, neural networks.
  - **Regression:** numeric outcome
  - **Classification:** ordered or unordered qualitative values.
- **Quantitative** data: numbers.
- **Qualitative** (nominal) data: non-numbers.
- Data can have different roles in analyses:
  - **Outcomes** (labels, endpoints, dependent variables): the value being predicted in supervised models.
  - **Predictors** (independent variables): the variables used to predict the outcome.

## The data analysis process

## The modeling process

![The modeling process.](https://www.tmwr.org/premade/modeling-process.svg)

- **Exploratory data analysis:** Explore the data to see what they might tell you.
  - Don't underestimate the time you'll need for **cleaning the data**. It's the step that the 'verse is named after!
  - Take time to **understand the data**.
  - Develop **clear expectations** of the goal of your model and how performance will be judged (Chapter 9).
- **Feature engineering:** Create specific model terms. Covered in Chapter 6.
- **Model tuning and selection:** Generate a variety of models and compare performance.
- **Model evaluation:** Use EDA-like analyses to choose the best model for your situation.
